# simple-weather-html-v2
One page HTML page with Javascript - Shows your current temperature and conditions

The index.html code works and is an "all-in-one" webpage. I have not figured out how to convert kelvin to *F. Currently the code is converting kelvin to *C.

The .html code pulls information from openweather.org. You must supply your own API key.

The weather.py code is not necessary, but exists to be used for some other project.

Google Gemini AI wrote the code for me.
